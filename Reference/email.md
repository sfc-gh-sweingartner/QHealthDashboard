Happy for you to prepare a demo in Streamlit with our existing (dummy) data – please find attached the following:

Problem statement
Claude generated data dictionaries for two of our dashboards (Q.CheckUp Lite and Q.Dose)

Also happy with you setting up the overview sessions for Snowflake’s AI capabilities & Marketplace – you can liaise with me on Slack for scheduling those sessions.

 
We did not get to discuss this in our session, but we have been exploring Streamlit on Snowflake for a different, but related use case. The data that feeds into Q.CheckUp relates to MedTech products, which we need to classify into a 4-level hierarchy. An example progression from Level 1 to 4 for a product is in the data dictionary. We currently use a combination of LLMs and manual intervention for this classification process and have recently built a Streamlit app to support it. In our next session, could we please discuss how this existing work might be incorporated into Quantium's broader Snowflake investment strategy?
