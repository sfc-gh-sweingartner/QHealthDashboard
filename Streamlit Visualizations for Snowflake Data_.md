A primary concern for the customer revolves around the perceived aesthetic limitations of standard Streamlit visualizations. This document aims to demonstrate that Streamlit, when strategically paired with powerful Python visualization libraries, can not only match but often surpass the interactive and aesthetic capabilities of conventional BI tools.

The strategic shift to "Streamlit in Snowflake" offers significant financial and operational advantages. By leveraging Snowflake's native integration with Streamlit, the need for complex Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines, external infrastructure, and redundant data movement is eliminated.1 This streamlined architecture leads to faster insights and a more robust security and governance framework, as applications operate directly where the data resides. This approach represents a fundamental architectural evolution, moving beyond mere cost savings to a more agile, Python-native data application ecosystem that is well-suited for integrating advanced analytics and machine learning outputs interactively.1 This underlying architectural change, where the analytical application moves to the data rather than the data moving to the application, inherently reduces security risks, simplifies compliance, and accelerates the development-to-deployment cycle for data-driven applications. This is particularly crucial for sensitive healthcare data, where data privacy and governance are paramount.

This report provides a comprehensive catalog of 20 advanced visualization ideas, specifically tailored for a broad healthcare dataset.

## **II. Introduction: Beyond Basic Charts – Why Streamlit in Snowflake Excels**

### **The Strategic Advantage: Cost-Efficiency and Seamless Data Access in Snowflake**

The integration of Streamlit directly within the Snowflake environment offers a compelling proposition for organizations seeking to modernize their data analytics capabilities. Running Streamlit applications natively in Snowflake significantly reduces operational complexities by eliminating the need for external infrastructure, such as dedicated servers or complex networking configurations.1 This means development teams can focus on building applications rather than managing underlying infrastructure.

Furthermore, this native integration ensures seamless data access, as Streamlit applications can directly query Snowflake tables without additional authentication layers or data movement. This co-location of compute and data translates into faster insights, as it avoids the latency typically associated with querying external BI tools. Beyond performance, Streamlit applications deployed within Snowflake inherit the platform's robust access control and security model, ensuring data privacy and compliance – a critical consideration for healthcare datasets. This architectural simplification leads to a notable reduction in IT operational overhead and a strengthened security posture, as sensitive data remains within Snowflake's secure and governed environment, simplifying adherence to regulatory requirements like HIPAA.

### **Dispelling the Myth: Streamlit's Capacity for Sophisticated and Interactive Visualizations**

The customer's concern regarding the visual appeal of Streamlit applications is a common initial perception, often arising from exposure to basic, out-of-the-box chart types. However, this perception overlooks Streamlit's true capability: it functions as a powerful, open-source Python framework designed to easily build and deploy interactive data applications with minimal code.1 Streamlit's strength lies not in its native drawing capabilities for complex charts, but in its ability to act as a sophisticated wrapper for a rich ecosystem of highly advanced Python visualization libraries, including Plotly, Altair, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.3

This means the aesthetic quality and interactive richness of a Streamlit application are primarily dictated by the chosen underlying visualization library and the developer's skill in leveraging its full feature set, rather than any inherent limitation of Streamlit itself. Streamlit provides the framework to seamlessly embed and interact with these powerful external libraries, offering features like real-time updates, interactive widgets (e.g., sliders, text inputs, buttons), and extensive customization options that collectively deliver a superior user experience.3 The platform's intuitive syntax allows developers to quickly modify code and see changes go live with side-by-side editor and app preview screens, accelerating the iterative development process.2 This capability to integrate and display highly sophisticated and interactive outputs from specialized libraries allows Streamlit to produce dashboards that can rival, and in many cases surpass, the dynamic and aesthetic capabilities of traditional BI tools.

### **Overview of Core Visualization Libraries in Your Current Stack**

The customer's existing Streamlit application already utilizes a strong foundation of Python libraries: altair, numpy, pandas, plotly, python-dateutil, requests, scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels, snowflake-snowpark-python, and streamlit.

* **pandas and numpy**: These are indispensable for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation, forming the backbone of any data processing workflow before visualization.  
* **scikit-learn and statsmodels**: These libraries are crucial for advanced analytical tasks, including machine learning model training, statistical inference, and predictive modeling. The outputs from these analyses (e.g., model predictions, feature importances, statistical relationships) can then be effectively visualized within Streamlit.  
* **plotly and altair**: These are the primary interactive visualization engines already in use. They are renowned for their ability to create dynamic, web-based charts that support user interaction, which is key to addressing the customer's desire for "nice looking" and interactive dashboards.4

Beyond these, the Anaconda Snowflake channel provides access to a vast array of additional popular Python packages, including seaborn, matplotlib, bokeh, and folium.5 This extensive library support ensures that developers have all the necessary tools to create a wide range of advanced and specialized visualizations directly within the Snowflake environment.

## **III. Deep Dive into Advanced Visualization Libraries for Healthcare Data**

This section details the capabilities of key Python visualization libraries, focusing on their strengths for healthcare data and their integration with Streamlit in Snowflake.

### **Plotly: Interactive and Publication-Quality Graphics**

Plotly stands out for its ability to generate interactive, publication-quality graphs that are well-suited for web-based applications.7 Its interactive features, such as zoom, pan, hover-over details, and the ability to toggle data series visibility, empower users to deeply explore data.8 Plotly supports an extensive range of chart types, including 3D scatter plots, various heatmaps, and specialized biomedical plots like Volcano Plots and Manhattan Plots, which are highly relevant for genetic and clinical research.1 The capacity to create animated plots is particularly beneficial for visualizing trends over time, such as changes in patient cholesterol levels or dynamic shifts in hospital patient volumes.8 Plotly Express, a high-level API within Plotly, simplifies the creation of complex and aesthetically pleasing plots with concise code.7

Streamlit provides native support for Plotly figures through the st.plotly\_chart function.9 This function offers critical parameters for customization and interactivity, including

use\_container\_width to adapt to the app's layout, theme="streamlit" for visual consistency, and, most notably, on\_select and selection\_mode.9 These interactive parameters allow Plotly charts to behave as input widgets, enabling users to filter or drill down into data by directly interacting with the visualization itself, such as clicking on a bar or drawing a lasso selection.10 This capability directly replicates and enhances the interactive filtering and drill-down functionalities found in traditional BI tools like Power BI and Tableau, offering a truly dynamic data exploration experience. Furthermore, for charts with a large number of data points (over 1000), Streamlit's

st.plotly\_chart can leverage Plotly's WebGL renderer, and offers the option to switch to SVG rendering (render\_mode="svg") to manage browser performance and context limits.9 This addresses potential performance concerns when visualizing extensive healthcare datasets by optimizing the rendering method.

### **Altair: Declarative Statistical Visualization**

Altair, built on the Vega-Lite visualization grammar, offers a declarative approach to creating statistical visualizations, making complex plots concise, readable, and highly maintainable.4 This declarative syntax is a significant advantage, particularly in healthcare analytics where reproducibility and clarity of code are paramount for research and compliance. It allows developers to describe

*what* they want to visualize rather than *how* to draw it pixel by pixel, often leading to more consistent and aesthetically pleasing results with less code. Altair excels at generating multi-view dashboards and implementing linked selections, where interactions in one chart (e.g., selecting a patient cohort) automatically filter or highlight corresponding data in other charts.12 This feature is ideal for exploring intricate relationships within broad healthcare datasets, such as patient demographics, treatment outcomes, or disease prevalence across different subgroups.14

Streamlit seamlessly integrates Altair charts using st.altair\_chart.12 This function provides similar capabilities to

st.plotly\_chart, including use\_container\_width for responsive layouts, theme="streamlit" for a cohesive visual design, and on\_select for enabling interactive filtering and callbacks.12 The

on\_select parameter allows the Streamlit application to react when a user makes a selection within an Altair chart, returning the selection data as a dictionary that can be used to update other parts of the application.12 This powerful combination fosters a "grammar of graphics" approach to healthcare data exploration, facilitating the creation of highly structured, multi-faceted dashboards where complex relationships can be intuitively explored through linked interactions, empowering non-technical users to derive insights without needing to write SQL queries.

### **Seaborn & Matplotlib: Statistical and Customizable Plots**

Matplotlib serves as the foundational plotting library in Python, providing extensive control and flexibility for creating a wide array of static, publication-quality figures.4 Seaborn, built on top of Matplotlib, offers a higher-level interface specifically designed for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.4 It is particularly well-suited for working with datasets that have multiple variables and includes features like automatic layout and styling.4

For healthcare data, Seaborn is excellent for visualizing distributions (e.g., age distribution of patient populations, lab result ranges), exploring relationships between variables (e.g., correlation heatmaps of medical parameters, scatter plots of patient vitals), and comparing categorical data (e.g., treatment success rates across different patient groups or hospital departments).17 Matplotlib, with its fine-grained control, is invaluable for highly customized layouts, creating subplots, or generating specific plot types that might not be available directly in higher-level libraries.17

Streamlit can display both Matplotlib and Seaborn plots using the st.pyplot() function.3 While these plots are inherently more static compared to the native interactivity of Plotly or Altair, they can be made dynamically interactive by combining them with Streamlit's input widgets (e.g., sliders, dropdowns, radio buttons). Changing a widget's value triggers a re-run of the Streamlit script, which then re-renders the Matplotlib/Seaborn plot with the new parameters, allowing users to explore different facets of the data. This combination fills a crucial analytical gap, providing tools for deep statistical analysis and highly customized, "publication-quality" visualizations within Streamlit, complementing the interactive dashboard capabilities of Plotly and Altair. Both

numpy and pandas are prerequisites for Seaborn, and matplotlib is its base; all are readily available in the Anaconda Snowflake channel.5

### **Folium: Geospatial Insights for Location-Based Healthcare Data**

Folium is a powerful Python library specifically designed for visualizing geospatial data on interactive maps, acting as a Python wrapper for the JavaScript library Leaflet.js.24 This capability is exceptionally valuable in healthcare for understanding spatial patterns and distributions. It enables the creation of choropleth maps to visualize disease incidence rates by geographic region (e.g., COVID-19 case density 25), mapping the locations of hospitals, clinics, or specialized medical facilities, and analyzing access to care based on population distribution.1 Folium also supports displaying information about hospital bed availability in rural and urban areas, and tracking the expansion of major diseases geographically.26

While Streamlit does not have a dedicated st.folium\_chart function, Folium maps are rendered as interactive HTML. These HTML outputs can be seamlessly embedded directly into a Streamlit application using st.components.v1.html. This method allows for the full interactivity of Folium maps (zoom, pan, pop-ups on markers) within the Streamlit interface.

Folium is not explicitly listed among the packages directly available in the Anaconda Snowflake channel.5 However, Snowflake's Snowpark environment supports the installation of additional Python packages via

pip into a temporary remote stage directory, which are then zipped and uploaded for use.27 Since Folium is primarily a Python wrapper for a JavaScript library and does not typically rely on complex OS-native code, it is highly compatible with this

pip-based installation method. This capability means that robust geospatial analysis, critical for public health initiatives, resource allocation, and understanding health disparities, is fully achievable within Streamlit on Snowflake, extending the platform's utility beyond traditional tabular data visualization to crucial spatial insights often found in specialized BI tools.

### **Bokeh: High-Performance Interactive Web Visualizations**

Bokeh is a Python library focused on creating highly interactive, web-based plots and live dashboards.4 It is particularly well-suited for scenarios involving very large or streaming datasets, offering high-performance interactivity directly in the browser.29 Bokeh's strength lies in its ability to build custom, complex visualizations with integrated interactive widgets such as sliders, buttons, and dropdown menus, which allow users to manipulate data and explore different views in real-time.29 This makes it an excellent choice for operational healthcare dashboards that require real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs), such as patient vital signs, hospital bed occupancy rates, or emergency department throughput.1

Streamlit provides direct integration for Bokeh plots through st.bokeh\_chart.12 This function allows for the embedding of Bokeh figures, enabling the rich interactivity that Bokeh is known for within the Streamlit application. Bokeh's

ColumnDataSource feature also facilitates advanced capabilities like sharing data between plots and filtering data, which is essential for building interconnected dashboard components.30 The availability of Bokeh-related packages like

bokeh-gl and bokeh-widgets in the Anaconda Snowflake channel strongly indicates that the core bokeh library is also available.5 This ensures direct compatibility and ease of deployment within the Streamlit in Snowflake environment, offering a flexible alternative to Plotly and Altair for specific high-performance or bespoke interactive visualization requirements.

### **NetworkX (for Graph-Based Healthcare Data)**

NetworkX is a fundamental Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks (graphs).31 While not a visualization library itself, it provides the data structures and algorithms necessary to model relationships that are prevalent in healthcare. This includes visualizing patient referral networks between physicians or hospitals, mapping disease transmission pathways, analyzing drug-drug interaction graphs, or understanding the organizational structure and communication flows within a healthcare system.15 By uncovering hidden relationships and identifying critical nodes (e.g., influential doctors, high-risk patient groups, or potential super-spreaders in an epidemic), NetworkX enables a deeper, more structural understanding of complex healthcare systems.

NetworkX graphs are typically visualized by integrating with other plotting libraries. Matplotlib (st.pyplot) can render basic network layouts, while Plotly (st.plotly\_chart) can be used to create interactive and aesthetically superior network graphs with hover details and dynamic layouts.

Similar to Folium, NetworkX is not explicitly listed in the Anaconda Snowflake channel.5 However, it is available via

conda-forge.31 As previously discussed, packages not directly in the Snowflake Anaconda channel can often be installed via

pip into a Snowflake stage.27 Since NetworkX is a pure Python package without complex OS-native dependencies, this installation method should be feasible. The ability to utilize NetworkX, even with this additional installation step, unlocks the capability for advanced graph-based analytics within Streamlit on Snowflake. This moves beyond traditional tabular or geospatial visualizations to reveal complex, non-linear relationships crucial for understanding patient journeys, disease spread, or optimizing healthcare operations, providing a unique analytical edge that is often absent in standard BI tools.

## **V. Technical Implementation Best Practices for Streamlit in Snowflake**

To maximize the impact and performance of Streamlit applications within Snowflake, adherence to certain best practices is crucial.

### **Optimizing Data Loading with Snowpark**

The efficiency of any Streamlit application in Snowflake heavily relies on how data is accessed and processed. Leveraging Snowpark is paramount for optimizing data loading. Instead of pulling large datasets into the Streamlit application's memory (which can be inefficient and slow), Snowpark allows for data processing and transformations to occur directly within Snowflake's powerful distributed compute engine.23 This "push-down" optimization minimizes data movement, enhances performance, and adheres to Snowflake's security model.

Developers should utilize Snowpark DataFrames for querying and manipulating data. For instance, instead of session.sql("SELECT \* FROM my\_table").collect(), which fetches all data, it is more efficient to perform aggregations, filters, and joins using Snowpark DataFrame operations within Snowflake before collecting only the necessary, aggregated results into a Pandas DataFrame for visualization. This approach ensures that only summarized or sampled data, relevant for the visualization, is transferred to the Streamlit application, significantly improving responsiveness.

### **Structuring Multi-Page Streamlit Apps**

As the number of visualizations and analytical views grows, structuring the Streamlit application into multiple pages becomes essential for user experience and maintainability. Streamlit supports multi-page applications, which can be organized with a clear navigation menu.32 This allows for logical grouping of related dashboards and reports, preventing a single, cluttered page.

Each page can focus on a specific aspect of the healthcare dataset (e.g., "Patient Demographics," "Operational KPIs," "Geospatial Analysis"), making the application more navigable and user-friendly. This modularity also aids in development, as different team members can work on separate pages, and updates can be deployed incrementally without affecting the entire application.

### **Leveraging Streamlit's Theming and Customization Options**

To address the customer's concern about visual appeal, it is important to leverage Streamlit's built-in theming capabilities and customization options. Streamlit allows for theme configuration via config.toml or directly within the code, enabling control over colors, fonts, and styles.32

Crucially, Plotly and Altair charts displayed via st.plotly\_chart and st.altair\_chart can inherit Streamlit's theme by setting theme="streamlit".9 This ensures visual consistency across all components of the application, creating a professional and cohesive look that rivals dedicated BI tools. Customizing the chart categorical and sequential color palettes through Streamlit's configuration options further enhances the aesthetic quality and brand alignment of the visualizations.9

### **Handling Interactivity and Callbacks (on\_select, st.session\_state)**

The interactive capabilities demonstrated in the "Ideas List" are powered by Streamlit's event handling mechanisms. The on\_select parameter for st.plotly\_chart and st.altair\_chart is fundamental. When set to "rerun", Streamlit re-executes the app script upon a user selection within the chart, returning a dictionary containing the selection data.9 This selection data can then be used to filter other charts, display detailed tables, or update summary statistics elsewhere on the page, creating a dynamic and interconnected dashboard experience.

For more complex state management and to persist data or selections across re-runs without re-querying Snowflake, st.session\_state is invaluable. It allows developers to store and retrieve variables, ensuring that user interactions feel seamless and responsive. Combining on\_select with st.session\_state enables the creation of sophisticated, multi-level interactive dashboards that empower users to drill down into specific data points and explore relationships with ease.

## **VI. Conclusion: Unlocking the Full Potential of Your Healthcare Data**
