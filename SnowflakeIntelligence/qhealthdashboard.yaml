  This comprehensive healthcare analytics semantic model provides deep insights into South African healthcare delivery, costs, and outcomes across two primary datasets: Q.CheckUp Lite (medical device and product claims) and Q.Dose (pharmaceutical prescriptions). 
  
  The model enables analysis of healthcare utilization patterns, cost optimization opportunities, provider performance, patient demographics, treatment pathways, and clinical outcomes. Users can explore questions about:
  
  **Financial Analytics**: Healthcare spending trends, claim patterns, cost drivers, payment source analysis, and budget optimization across medical schemes, providers, and geographic regions.
  
  **Clinical Insights**: Treatment patterns, medication usage, disease management, therapeutic outcomes, and population health trends across different patient demographics and clinical conditions.
  
  **Provider Analytics**: Hospital and pharmacy performance, network utilization, provider efficiency, geographic service delivery patterns, and quality metrics.
  
  **Population Health**: Demographic health trends, geographic disease patterns, age-specific treatment needs, gender-based healthcare utilization, and preventive care analysis.
  
  **Operational Intelligence**: Supply chain insights, inventory management, demand forecasting, seasonal patterns, and resource allocation optimization.
  
  The data covers comprehensive healthcare claims across South Africa's nine provinces, including major medical schemes (Discovery Health, Bonitas, Momentum Health), leading provider networks (Netcare, Life Healthcare, Mediclinic), and extensive pharmaceutical and medical device catalogs with ATC classification hierarchies.
  
  All patient data is synthetic and anonymized, ensuring privacy compliance while maintaining realistic healthcare patterns for meaningful analysis and decision-making.

  When analyzing healthcare data, always consider:
  1. Patient privacy - all data is synthetic and anonymized
  2. Clinical context - interpret medical codes and classifications appropriately  
  3. Financial accuracy - distinguish between claimed amounts and paid amounts
  4. Geographic relevance - focus on South African healthcare context
  5. Temporal patterns - consider seasonal healthcare trends
  6. Provider networks - understand relationships between different healthcare providers
  7. Regulatory compliance - consider South African medical scheme regulations
  8. ATC classification - use the 5-level ATC hierarchy for pharmaceutical analysis
  9. Medical device categorization - utilize the 4-level product hierarchy for devices
  10. Cost optimization - identify opportunities for healthcare cost savings while maintaining quality care
